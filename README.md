# ezShip Overview

**WORK IN PROGRESS**
 
ezShip is a basic Python implementation of a custom shipping carrier's labeling process. This program will handle the generation of labels, storing sender/receiver information, along with barcodes for easy access of information. (Eventually) a barcode can be scanned by a "location device" to update the parcel's location.
